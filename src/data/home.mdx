## Projects

I've mainly worked on projects for fun, few of those are:
- [Mito](https://github.com/kushagraraj/mito): A multipurpose discord bot made using typescript. Sadly, discontinued.
- [Color Convertor](https://kushagraraj.github.io/color-converter): a simple RGB to hex colour converter made using js and html.
- This website!: I hope you like it.
- more stuff is yet to come âœ¨
